# ML Frameworks

There are different training frameworks used by the data science community. These frameworks are used to build, i.e. train, deep learning models using their libraries with the data (training data). The framework libraries are used to represent the details of the underlying machine learning algorithms in the model. Examples of training frameworks are Tensorflow, Pytorch and Caffe2.

These frameworks also have inteference engines that are used to execute the deep neural network models. The inference engine is also referred to as the runtime. This runtime is capable of translating the operators in the DNN model into computation steps that are executed when input data is provided to the model.
