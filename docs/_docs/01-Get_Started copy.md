This guide will start you on your vision AI journey with the **Vision AI DevKit**, taking you from setting up your Microsoft Azure account to seeing video output from the DevKit camera of recognized objects. We will use a VisionSample model for this process, which has been trained to recognize up to 183 different objects.
