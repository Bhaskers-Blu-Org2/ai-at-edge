### What is machine learning?

New in machine learning (ML) and AI field? Get familiar with [machine learning]({{ '/docs/machine_learning/' | relative_url }}).

### [Use ONNX]({{ '/docs/onnx/' | relative_url }}) - Open Neural Network Exchange

ONNX is open format to represent traditional and deep learning models. It's developed in co-operation between Microsoft, Facebook, AWS and several other partners.

### [Azure Cognitive Servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/welcome){:target="_blank"}

Azure Cognitive Services are APIs, SDKs, and services available to help developers build intelligent applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge. Azure Cognitive Services enable developers to easily add cognitive features into their applications. 

### Ready get started?

- Create you vision AI model with [Custom Vision]({{ '/docs/customvision/' | relative_url }}).
- Start development with [Azure Machine Learning]({{ '/docs/aml/' | relative_url }}).
- Find [AI models]({{ '/docs/find_ml/' | relative_url }}).

### Characteristics of main machine learning use cases

| | **Vision** | **Audio** | **Telemetry** |

| **Summary** | Vision AI is specialized machine learning for images and video that allows you to transform camera input into labels and objects that you can use in your applications and busineses logic. | Machine learning solutions for audio can be further categorized into two main subcategories - speech to text used for example by smart assistant and anomaly detection based on sound | Telemetry refers to numeric data received from multiple different kinds of sensors for example temperature or pressure. The telemetry data amounts produced are typically significantly smaller than with vision or audio |
| **Typical use cases** | Workplace safety, Retail, Quality control (anommaly detection), Smart home/building/city, Access control | Speech to text, anomaly detection (predective maintenance) | Anomaly detection, Predective maintenance |
| **Main challenges** | Large amounts of data, HW acceleration needed for real time inferencing | Speech to text: Microphone and model dependency, Acquiring audio transcription data for training | Building a model often requires in depth machine learning knowledge. Limited amount of tools available. |
