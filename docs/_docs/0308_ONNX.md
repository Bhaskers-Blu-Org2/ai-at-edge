### What is ONNX - Open Neural Network Exchange 

[ONNX](https://onnx.ai/){:target="_blank"} is an open format to represent both deep learning and traditional models. With ONNX, AI developers can more easily move models between state-of-the-art tools and choose the combination that is best for them. ONNX is developed and supported by a community of partners such as Microsoft, Facebook and AWS.

ONNX is widely supported and can be found in many frameworks, tools, and hardware. Enabling interoperability between different frameworks and streamlining the path from research to production helps increase the speed of innovation in the AI community. ONNX helps to solve the challenge of hardware dependency related to AI models and enables deploying same AI models to several HW accelerated targets.

- More information regarding ONNX can be found from [ONNX Runtime web pages](https://microsoft.github.io/onnxruntime/){:target="_blank"}
- Microsoft's blog regarding announcing [ONNX Runtime 1.0](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2019/10/30/announcing-onnx-runtime-1-0/){:target="_blank"}

### Get started with ONNX

Train an ONNX model using [Azure Machine Learning](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/deployment/onnx){:target="_blank"}.

### Convert your model to ONNX

[Convert to ONNX](https://github.com/microsoft/OLive/tree/master/docker-images/onnx-converter){:target="_blank"}
- Use ONNX Converter Image to convert other major model frameworks to ONNX. Supported frameworks are currently
  - CNTK, CoreML, Keras, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch

### Get started with examples

Here is a list of product examples using a ONNX and tested combination of hardware and AI model. 

{% assign pageTag = "onnx" %}

<div class="grid__wrapper grid__catalog">

  {% assign projects = '' | split: '' %} {% comment %} Empty array {% endcomment %}

  {% for project in site.projects %}
  
    {% comment %} Collect all the multi-part projects based on the presence of the part attribute of the file {% endcomment %}
    {% if project.part != nil and project.part == 1 %}
      {% assign projects = projects | push: project %}
      
    {% comment %} Collect all the single page projects {% endcomment %}
    {% elsif project.part == nil %}
      {% assign projects = projects | push: project %}
    
    {% endif %}

  {% endfor %}


  {% for post in projects %}
    {% for tag in post.tags %}
    {% if tag contains pageTag %}
       {% include archive-single.html type="grid" %}
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
 {% endfor %}
</div>
