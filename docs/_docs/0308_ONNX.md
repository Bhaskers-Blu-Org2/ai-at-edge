### What is ONNX - Open Neural Network Exchange 

[ONNX](https://onnx.ai/){:target="_blank"} is an open format to represent both deep learning and traditional models. With ONNX, AI developers can more easily move models between state-of-the-art tools and choose the combination that is best for them. ONNX is developed and supported by a community of partners such as Microsoft, Facebook and AWS.

ONNX is widely supported and can be found in many frameworks, tools, and hardware. Enabling interoperability between different frameworks and streamlining the path from research to production helps increase the speed of innovation in the AI community. ONNX helps to solve the challenge of hardware dependency related to AI models and enables deploying same AI models to several HW accelerated targets.
