The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.

While this project doesn't really qualify as AI@Edge it's for sure a fun project that you can use to impress other in Christmas parties. This project walks you through the process of adding Raspberry Pi controlled leds to an ugly sweater and not only to be able to control them, but to get them light up using Twitter.
