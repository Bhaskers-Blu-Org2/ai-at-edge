## Run ONNX models with Jetson Nano

| **[Jetson Nano](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/){:target="_blank"}** |  |
| :----------- |
| NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™ Developer Kit is a small, powerful computer that lets you run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing. All in an easy-to-use platform that runs in as little as 5 watts. It opens new worlds of embedded IoT applications, including entry-level Network Video Recorders (NVRs), home robots, and intelligent gateways with full analytics capabilities. | ![Jetson Nano]({{ '/assets/images/devices_jetson_nano.jpg' | relative_url }}) | 

| Solution example |
| :----------- |
| This solution example provides step by step instructions for enabling [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/){:target="_blank"} on Jetson Nano. ONNX is an open format to represent deep learning models. With ONNX, AI developers can more easily move models between state-of-the-art tools and choose the combination that is best for them. ONNX is developed and supported by a community of partners. Use this example to enable running ONNX models with Jetson Nano.
