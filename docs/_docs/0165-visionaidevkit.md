## Workplace safety with Vision AI Developer Kit

| **[Vision AI Developer Kit](https://www.visionaidevkit.com){:target="_blank"}** |  |
| :----------- |
| Vision AI Dev Kit provides a quick start to intelligent edge, machine learning and Azure services. you can start your machine learning journey with this Dev Kit or use it to proof your concept in enterprise use before deciding to go to production. The camera can be used to take pictures to train a Vision AI model that classifies image in the environment where it will eventually be used. | ![Vision AI Dev Kit]({{ '/assets/images/DEVKIT_vaidk.png' | relative_url }}) | 
| You can start developing an AI model by using <a href="http://Customvision.ai">Customvision.ai</a>, a web portal with easy to use UI, to train your AI model and export it in the format that can be directly deployed to Vision AI Dev Kit. More experienced with ML? Vision AI Dev Kit web pages offer tutorials for developing an image classification model using Azure Machine Learning services as well. |  |

| Solution example |
| :----------- |
| This project demonstrates the implementation of a Custom Vision ML model to the Vision AI DevKit to identify the presence of workplace safety equipment such as hardhats, vests, and safety glasses. As each object is detected, the information is stored and an alarm is triggered when a person that is not wearing the specified eqipment is detected in the frame.
