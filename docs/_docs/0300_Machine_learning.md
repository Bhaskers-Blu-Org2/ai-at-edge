## What is machine learning?

In short machine learning is a science that provides a computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It's based on the usage of algorithms that analyze data, learn from it and make a specified prediction. Running machine learning models requires often a lot of computing power and it is common to run them algorithms, AI models, in the cloud. Edge computing brings that capability to the devices
