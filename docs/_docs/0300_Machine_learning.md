## What is machine learning?

In short machine learning is a science that provides a computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It's based on the usage of algorithms that analyze data, learn from it and make a specified prediction. Running machine learning models requires often a lot of computing power and it is common to run them algorithms, AI models, in the cloud. Edge computing brings that capability to the devices

| Vision AI is specialized machine learning for images and video that allows you to transform camera input into labels and objects that you can use in your applications and busineses logic. | Machine learning solutions for audio can be further categorized into two main subcategories - speech to text used for example by smart assistant and anomaly detection based on sound | Telemetry refers to numeric data received from multiple different kinds of sensors. Telemetry data can reflect for example temperature or pressure. |
