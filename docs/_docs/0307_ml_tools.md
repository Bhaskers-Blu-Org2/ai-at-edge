### Tools

Microsoft offers multiple tools for training, packaging and deploying the model. 

[Custom Vision]({{ '/docs/customvision/' | relative_url }}) offers an easy to use UI for creation Vision AI model.

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/){:target="_blank"} are commonly used by data scientists for developing machine learning models. Many of the machine learning communities and community projects provide a set of Jupyter Notebooks to get started with the specific ML model.
- [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/){:target="_blank"} provides online access to Jupyter notebooks running in the cloud on Microsoft Azure. The portal also contains a comprehensive set of default projects to get started with Jupyter Notebooks. See [Azure Notebooks documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notebooks/){:target="_blank"}
- Jupyter Notebooks can be run using local hardware like laptop or creating Notebook VM (Virtual MAchine) in [Azure Machine Learning Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-manage-workspace){:target="_blank"}.

Other possible solutions include:
- [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py){:target="_blank"} enables python based development.
- Automate your machine learning activities with the [Azure Machine Learning CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/reference-azure-machine-learning-cli){:target="_blank"}.
- Write code in Visual Studio Code with [Azure Machine Learning VS Code extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-vscode-tools){:target="_blank"}
- Use the [visual interface (preview) for Azure Machine Learning service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/ui-concept-visual-interface){:target="_blank"} to perform the workflow steps without writing code.
