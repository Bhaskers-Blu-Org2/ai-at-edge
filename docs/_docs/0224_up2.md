## Run ONNX models with Intel UP Squared

| **[Intel UP Squared](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/up-squared-ai-vision-dev-kit){:target="_blank"}** |  |
| :----------- |
| The UP Squared is a high performance kit that provides a clear path to production, simple set up and configuration with pre-installed Ubuntu OS, expanded I/O to help with rapid prototyping, and a means to incorporate complex and advanced libraries in an intuitive fashion. All bundled into one package along with prototyping sensors with a clear path to industrial grade sensors for commercial deployments.  | ![UP2]({{ '/assets/images/devices_up2.png' | relative_url }}) | 

| Solution example |
| :----------- |
| This solution example provides step by step instructions for enabling [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/){:target="_blank"} on Intel UP Squared. ONNX is an open format to represent deep learning models. With ONNX, AI developers can more easily move models between state-of-the-art tools and choose the combination that is best for them. ONNX is developed and supported by a community of partners. Use this example to enable running ONNX models with Jetson Nano.
