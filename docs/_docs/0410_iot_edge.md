### Enable AI@Edge with Azure IoT Edge

[Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/){:target="_blank"}, built on top of Azure IoT Hub, is used to analyze data on devices, at the edge, without relying on a cloud connection. Azure IoT Edge enables devices to spend less time sending messages to the cloud, providing faster reaction to local monitored changes.

Azure IoT Edge moves cloud analytics and custom business logic to devices so that your organization can focus on business insights instead of data management. Scale out your IoT solution by packaging your business logic into standard containers, then you can deploy those containers to any of your devices and monitor it all from the cloud.
