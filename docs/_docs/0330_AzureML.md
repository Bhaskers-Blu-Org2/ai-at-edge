### [Azure Machine Learning Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/)

Azure Machine Learning (AML) service provides a cloud-based environment to build ML applications. Using AML you can train models with data prepared for the specific scenario, test the model, package as container to deploy in the cloud or an edge device. AML enables you to manage the full life cycle of ML development by tracking models, collecting telemetry for performance and enabling you to update models in your application as needed.
