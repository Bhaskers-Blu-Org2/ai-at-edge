<tr><td>
NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™ Developer Kit is a small, powerful computer that lets you run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing. All in an easy-to-use platform that runs in as little as 5 watts. It opens new worlds of embedded IoT applications, including entry-level Network Video Recorders (NVRs), home robots, and intelligent gateways with full analytics capabilities.

Solution example - turn your installed RSTP cameras into sensors
</b></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
With Azure IoT Edge and NVIDIA® <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk" target="_blank">DeepStream</a>, you can take a small, inexpensive NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™ Developer Kit and analyze HD video streams in real-time.  You can add an Azure IoT Edge device in the field to turn your RSTP cameras into sensors for IoT applications in retail stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities, connected buildings, urban infrastructure, and more.

With smarter algorithms, you can squeeze more video streams from your hardware. That’s where the DeepStream toolkit comes in. It helps you set up your analytics pipeline.  You can easily configure DeepStream to efficiently ingest as many video streams as you need.
<br>
DeepStream also allows you to layer multiple AI models. For example, if you are analyzing video data from a construction site, you can use one model to identify a work person and you can use a second model to confirm whether the work person is wearing a hard hat and safety gloves.
